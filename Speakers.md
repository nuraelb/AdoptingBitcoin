## CONTRIBUTE AND SUPPORT BITCOIN ADOPTION 

We strive to make Adopting Bitcoin that convention that brings together the independently working builders: to update themselves and share their own learnings on how to achieve the common goal to make a fairer economy and financial system a reality for more people. If you are working on furthering Bitcoin adoption, we want you to come and share with us in El Salvador. We want to hear from you and your part of the world, your techniques, efforts and successes.

All Bitcoin advocates, community builders, educators, entrepreneurs, developers, investors, and designers are welcome to join the conversation!  

## TRACKS INFORMATION 

The event will feature two Main Stages: 

- **ECON track**: How to kickstart a Bitcoin economy bottom up and top down, including all the key stepping stones that need to be established to ensure its success and longevity.

In addition to the main stages, the participants will be able to participate in a multitude of other activities, that will make each attendeeâ€™s experience unique:
